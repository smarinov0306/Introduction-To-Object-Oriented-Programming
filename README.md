FLOWER SHOP - Your company receives a project to create an application serving a chain of flower shops. Your software must describe a flower (Flower) and a flower store (FlowerStore).

You need to implement functionality that allows adding flowers and flower shops, and subsequently adding, selling and other operations with these flowers - all this will work through commands that you will receive. The sequence of commands ends with a STOP command.
